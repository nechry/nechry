### About me ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Jean-FranÃ§ois, I live in Switzerland and I am a full-time IoT solution engineer and passionate about home automation on my free time.

By nature I like to share, that's why I got involved in several open source projects ðŸ”­:
- I am part of the organization [Openzwave](https://github.com/OpenZWave) as a contributor to the openzwave library since 2015 already.
- I previously developed and maintained the [plugin-openzwave](https://github.com/jeedom/plugin-openzwave) for jeedom gateways.
- I also helped and maintained [python-openzwave](https://github.com/OpenZWave/python-openzwave) for a while.

At last, I share content on my private Blog, [Nechry home automation](https://nechry-automation.ch/), it's a home automation blog that mainly deals with the Z-Wave protocol and good practices.

If you find my work useful, consider supporting me as a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/nechry)

Thank you in advance!
